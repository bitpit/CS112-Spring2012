Good Formatting:
     Helps understand error
     Helps teachers grading our work
     Helps others interpert what it is we're trying to say

Using apporpriate variables for what you're storing.
     Use something that's more descriptive and makes sense with the function

Constants are ALL CAPS
Dont make the first letter capital in general (yet- we'll find out why later)
Camel caps - capitilze the first letter of every word after the first
python uses underscores instead to give long, descriptive easy to read variable
     names

leading underscores makes stuff private **

commenting - 
     put em in there so people can read what the fuck you're trying to say'
     

spacing - spaces around = sign - spacing wont change the way itll run, just make
     it easier to read

use WIDTH and HEIGHT constants
