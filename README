* Name: Evan Ricketts
* Programming Background: Not too much, worked with some old basic languages for
a project last semester and some ardiuno stuff for another project before that.
Also wrote applescript many years ago, though I'm not sure if that counts.
* What you hope to get from the course: I am quite eager to improve my programming
skills in conjunction with my artistic abilities, as I see video games to be the
greatest combination of computer and art that exists. Despite my limited previous
experience, I'm quite excited to tackle the subject and do some programming.
